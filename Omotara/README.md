# TheOrganicMecanique

// The current piece that I am working on is the inorganic tree. It took me a while to understand the code, and I still don't. There is a lot of physics involved as well as multiple classes within the package. I tried reading the documentation page, but it still wasn't very clear. I don't think we should use this tree especially because it doesn't look aesthetically pleasing with the other tree.
